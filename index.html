        <h1>Welcome to my programming webpage.</h1>
        <h2>Thanks for stoppping by.</h2>
        <h3>What is this page?</h3>
        <p>This page is going to be my personal website that I am later going to use to
            market myself to potential employers. I am very early on in my computer science 
            journey but I feel like I have found my calling. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>So what does this have to do with this page?</strong>Right now this page
            is very basic. Over time, this page is going to 
        evolve and become more complex. I will continually update it as I learn more things. </p> 

        <p>I have a long way to go but untill then......</p>
        <p><em>Forward!!!</em></p>
